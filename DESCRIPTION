Description: Provides a simple interface for initializing 'future' parallel
    evaluation plans without needing to remember the various plan constructors
    and tweaking syntax. Supports multicore, multisession, callr, and mirai
    backends with sensible defaults for memory limits and worker counts.
    Includes utilities for plan inspection, temporary plan switching,
    backend benchmarking, SLURM/HPC environment integration, a unified
    options controller, and system capabilities reporting.
